# Classification Model

Accuracy is not a good metric to use when you have class imbalance.
The problem here is that an accuracy of 99% sounds like a great result, whereas your model performs very poorly.
The goal of the F1 score is to combine the precision and recall metrics into a single metric.
the F1 score has been designed to work well on imbalanced data.
